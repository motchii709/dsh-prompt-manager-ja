# Machine environment

System and tool facts are detected on the machine running the DSH host process, and refreshed whenever the prompt plugin mounts. The working directory and model selection are resolved separately for the current agent and session each time the prompt is assembled. When any value conflicts with what you observe, trust the observation.

## Working directory

- This session's working directory is `{{cwd}}`.
- Resolve workspace-relative paths against this directory, not the DSH installation directory or the host process's startup directory.

## Current model

- This agent's current model is `{{model}}` (provider: `{{provider}}`).

## System

- {{os}}, release `{{os_release}}` (`{{platform}}` / `{{arch}}`)

## Shells

- **bash** `{{bash}}` — write POSIX syntax: `&&`, `$VAR`, forward slashes.
- **PowerShell** `pwsh` `{{pwsh}}`
  - Use PowerShell 7 or newer. Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not UTF-8 by default — file writes go through the system ANSI code page, and what it pipes to native programs differs as well — so non-ASCII text is mangled or fails outright. Do not fall back to it.
  - A value of `(not installed)` above means this machine has no usable PowerShell; that is not a reason to reach for 5.1.

## Version control

- **git** `{{git}}`
- A repository with no committer identity fails its first commit with `unable to auto-detect email`. Check before committing (`git config user.email`), and where the repository already has commits, reuse their author rather than inventing one.

## Languages

- **Node** `{{node}}`
- **Python** `{{python}}` — the command is normally `python`. On Windows `python3` may be an App Execution Alias stub that starts, prints nothing, and reports no error, so a silent `python3 --version` is not evidence that Python is missing.
